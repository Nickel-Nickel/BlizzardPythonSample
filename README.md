This code is from a recent assignment in my Python class, where we were tasked to write a program to keep track of a list of employees using classes. Though we were given an outline of what to do, as well as how our outputs should look, all code is written from scratch.

The files of interest here are main.py and contacts.py.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you!
